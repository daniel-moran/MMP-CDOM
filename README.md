# MMP-CDOM
MMP CDOM data processing and aggregation workflows.

This Repo was established by Dan Moran 11/06/25 to house existing scripts that were originally developed in 2020
and have been refined over the intermediate years.

The intended workflow is that these scripts should be pulled from the repo to be run locally on the users 
machine for the purposes of processing raw CDOM data analysed on the AIMS WQ lab Shimadzu UV-Vis spec. The 
processed data is then aggregated into a single summary file to populate Oracle Feeder sheets 
- see "\\Pearl\rwqpp\Methods\QAQC and data management procedures" for more details on data ingest processes 
using the feeder sheets.

Any updates or improvements to the scripts can be pushed to the repo for future use.

Additional detail on intended use and protocols will be added here and are also documented in header details 
of the scripts.
